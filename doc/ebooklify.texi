@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

@t{ebooklify} is an Emacs utility that can transform a collection of
documents in a given format into an eBook.  It uses @t{pandoc} to first
convert the documents into @TeX{}, and @t{tex4ebook} to then create the
eBook itself.

Documents can be retrieved from different backends – currently, it only
supports MongoDB.
